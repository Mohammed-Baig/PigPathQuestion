# PigPathQuestion

Hello reader! Over here is the code for a question I had in grade 12. The user inputs the coordinates of a barn on fire, a source of water and
and unmoavable object. The pigs must find the fastest way to form a bucket brigade between the water and the barn with the shortest amount
of pigs needed. Pigs must go around the object. The code then calculates and prints the minimum number of pigs needed, as well as the 
10x10 grid. Have fun!

Note: everything here was coded in C
